<!--
	In this lesson we will create a style sheet in the
    HTML file and one CSS-file and link them together
    
    When writing CSS scripts you select a tag and set its properties
    
    i.e:
    	h1
        {
        	font-size: x-large;
            font-weight: bold;
        }
        
        selector
        {
        	property_01: value;
            property_02: value;
            etc.
        }
    IMPORTANT: all commands in CSS must be ended with a semicolor (;) or the command won't be executed
        
    When calling CSS inside your HTML file you write
    <style type="text/css">
    h1 {font-size: x-large; font-weight: bold;}
    </style>
        
    When calling a CSS class from your HTML file
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css" type="text/css" />
        
    You can also create specific Ids which overrides the default selector for that tag.
    i.e:
    	HTML:	<span id="footer">This is a footer</span> 
        CSS:	#footer {font-size: small;}
            
	Different units of measurement:
    em - Relative; height of the element's font
    ex - Relative; height of the x character in element's font
    px - Relative; pixels
    in - Absolute; inches
    cm - Absolute; centimeters
    mm - Absolute; milimeters
    pt - Absolute; points
    pc - Absolute; picas
    
    	Absolute - in theory these units respont to real world measurements
        Relative - based on a more arbitrary unit of measurement

        <!--
        	It's not very fun to write CSS inside the HTML file and it doesn't look 
            very clean so lets move the CSS script to a separate CSS file which will
            link in to our HTML document. There are numerus advanteges with keeping the CSS
            spripts in a separate file, its easier to manage, can be reused for multiple
            pages and it generally looks better.
            
            so create a new file called style.css and save it in the same folder as
            your HTML file.
            
            then we add new box which we will centeter on the screen
            
        -->
        <!-- Here we call our class "NewBox" which we have customized in our CSS-file -->

        <div class="NewBox"> 
        	Here is some text to fill fill our new box
        </div>

        <!-- We can also customize the <body> of our web page inside the CSS doc -->
        <!--
        <p class="rightBox">There is some text</p>
        <p class="mainBox">Here is some more text</p>
