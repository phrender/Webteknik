<!--
	In this lesson we will look and different kinds of images, how to include them
    on your web page, using them as links, setting upp assigned links to images
    with the help of the clients imagemap and provide alternatives for
    browsers that can't display images.
    
    We are going to look at changeing fonts and background colors,
    how to use our images and when, and tiled images.
    
    Imagetypes:
    	GIF - Graphics Interchange Format, was a popular image format and is now OK for logos
        icons, line art and simpler images.
        
    	JPEG - Joint photographic Experts Group, good for photographic and graphical elements
        but not so well for separating lines, sharp edges, logos and icons.
        
        PNG - Portable Network Graphics, was originaly designed to replaced GIF, no data is lost
        during compression like in the other formats.
        
        <img /> - Standard image tag
        <img src="" /> - Image tag with a source to an image
        <img src="" atl="" /> - Image tag with a source and alternative text if the image is not avalible or if the browser can't display the image

        	The <body> tag can be assigned a background image via CSS
            i.e:
            	from HTML:
                	This is how you assign a image
                	style="background-image: url(imagefilename.format);"

                    there are more options avalible if you have a image
                    that don't cover the whole screen area and that is
                    a repear setting you can enable or disable using:
                    style="background-image: url(imagefilename.format); background-repear: no-repeat;"
                    
                    if you want the picture to be fixed or scroll
                    with the page you use a attachment setting and 
                    set it to either fixed or scrolling
                    style="background-image: url(imagefilename.format); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-attachment: fixed"
